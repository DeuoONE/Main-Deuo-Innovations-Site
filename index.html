									<h3>About Me!</h3>
									<p>Hi there! My name is Ryan but my Internet Alias is ZenDeuo, I currently spend most of my time learning and mastering my skills to put them to good use in the upcoming project that I'm going to make.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Learning To Become A Developer!</h3>
									<p>I currently go to College and I use both my Own Time and College Time to learn how to become a Full-Stack Developer as it is something I strive to be and want to do in life, I want to make puters boop beep at me and work.</p>

									<h3>Learning & Mastering Adobe Premier Pro So That I Can Edit Videos In Style!</h3>
									<p>I've always had a thing for Video Editing, but I've just never been able to quite get there and Master My Skills, but now I want to spend all my time working on the skills I want to learn and get there on my own terms and being successful with the skills I gain from learning and mastering these things.</p>

									<h3>How Am I Going To Do This All By Myself You Might Ask? Well...</h3>
									<p>People do say I am quite a Gem to have around, but I've set this in stone, and that's the reason for the Year-Long Timeframe on this project because I can't promise I'll be able to get it done Half-Way through the year or even right at the end, I'm not promising that this project will be complete by the time this year is over, since I'm still learning and developing my skills in and out of college. I have currently an infinite amount of time to work this stuff out, so it's all about thinking, tweaking and working things out but until then it's mostly chill from here.</p>
